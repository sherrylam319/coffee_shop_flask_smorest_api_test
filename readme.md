# API Tests for the coffee shop flask app

## Introduction

This API tests contain two parts, unit tests and integration tests.

The code here is similar to the course I learned it from - https://github.com/tecladocode/rest-api-smorest-docker/tree/c9a637e0b280ffbb0d746538884f895bf8fafc81 ,with some modification. The purpose of this is to practice my API testing skills, 
as well as to learn the basic development process of the backend of an app.
